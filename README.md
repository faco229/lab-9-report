## Introduction / Summary

This lab involves implementing a control system to maintain a robot at a specified distance from an object using an ultrasonic distance module as the sensor and car motors as the actuators. A proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller will be implemented and tuned on an Arduino to achieve this goal. The PID controller, a process developed in the 1600s to control the speed of a grain feeder, is now widely used in various industries. It calculates the error between the desired value (setpoint) and the measured value, feeding this error into an amplifier, an integrator, and a differentiator. The outputs are summed and applied to the process actuator, with each block containing a parameter that adjusts its effect on the overall process. Many microcontrollers, including Arduino devices, can run the PID library, which will be utilized in this lab.
